problem:
In a busy university setting, tracking attendance shouldn’t feel like a throwback to grade school roll calls. 
But for many universities, it's still a time-consuming process—requiring Resident Assistants or wardens to knock on dorm room doors, checklists in hand, as students wait around to be counted. 
It’s disruptive, outdated, and often inconvenient for students who are scattered across campus in libraries, dining halls, or on the sports field.

preliminary research:
Polygon-based geofencing is a location-based technology that uses custom-defined geographical areas to trigger actions or validate events. Unlike circular geofences, which rely on a single center point and radius, polygon geofencing allows users to create precise, irregular boundaries by connecting multiple latitude and longitude points into a polygon.
In practical applications, such as attendance systems, administrators can define geofenced zones by drawing polygons on a digital map. These polygons are stored as geospatial data and used to determine if a user's GPS location lies within the boundary. Algorithms like point-in-polygon calculations (using libraries such as Turf.js or PostGIS) ensure accurate location verification.
Polygon geofencing is ideal for environments with irregular shapes, such as university campuses or housing complexes, as it provides more flexibility and precision compared to simple circular zones.


solution: 
Enter Uni-Link — the smart, campus-wide attendance solution designed for the modern universities.
This application enables universities to set a designated radius within campus boundaries for attendance verification. 
When it’s time to check in, students receive a notification on their mobile devices, prompting them to quickly authenticate with fingerprint . 
The app then confirms their location using GPS, ensuring they’re within the campus radius without needing to return to their dorms.
In less than 10 seconds, administrators have a comprehensive list of present students, and students can continue their activities without interruption.
With Uni-Link, attendance goes digital—secure, efficient, and hassle-free. No more door-to-door checks, just a smart, streamlined solution for modern campus life.

execution: 
-For this we would be creating an intuitive app interface for students.The design will prioritize ease of use, with quick access to notifications, authentication, and attendance tracking.
- The app would incorporate biometric authentication  to ensure secure identity verification for each student.
-We would be using geofencing technology where we would set up the designated campus radus. thus allowing the app to accurately detect when students are within the defined area.
- We would implement a real-time notification system to prompt students at scheduled attendance times. 
-We have developed a robust backend to store student attendance data securely and generate real-time attendance lists for administrators.
-We would create a dashboard for university administrators to manage attendance records, set attendance times, and view real-time data on student presence
